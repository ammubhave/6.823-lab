You will need to install g++-multilib to compile the program for 32-bit.
Because Murphi is so old, it doesn't work correctly if we execute a 64-bit
binary. You will have to compile it for 32-bit and run on any
32-bit/64-bit machine. You are welcome to make it work for 64-bit if you
want to.

This directory contains the source code for the Murphi Compiler 
Release 3.1.

Please follow the following steps to generate the executable of the 
Murphi Compiler (mu) if you do not find an executable for your machine 
in the bin directory:
- edit the Makefile to select the correct C++ compiler for your machine
- build the Murphi compiler with "make mu"
- set the link in the bin directory with "ln -s ../src/mu mu", if the link
 has not already been created.

If you want to do changes in the Murphi language, read the Rebuild.Note 
and the Hacker.Manual1.
